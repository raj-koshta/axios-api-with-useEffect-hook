# 🚀 Day 3 of My Learning Journey: Axios and React useEffect Hook 🚀

As part of my Learning Everyday challenge, today I dove into Axios – a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests in JavaScript – and explored how to use it alongside React's useEffect hook. 🌐

Key Takeaways from Today’s Learning:

1️⃣ What is Axios?
Axios simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests. With its easy-to-use methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, it’s a great tool for interacting with APIs and fetching data in your JavaScript applications.

2️⃣ How to Use Axios with useEffect in React:
The useEffect hook is the perfect place to trigger side effects, like fetching data, when a component mounts.
Using Axios inside useEffect, I learned how to call APIs and handle the data efficiently while managing loading and error states.

3️⃣ Error Handling:
One key part of today’s learning was error handling. I implemented logic to handle loading states and capture errors when making API requests. This helps in ensuring a smooth user experience, even when things go wrong.

4️⃣ Practical Application:
I’ve built a small React app that fetches data from a public API using Axios. The app includes loading indicators, success states, and proper error handling to ensure smooth interaction.

I’m excited to continue growing as a developer and can’t wait to share more learnings with you all along the way! 🌱
